# The Everpuccin Theme
This colorscheme was heavily inspired by everforest, and based on Cattpuccin for easy modification and configuration.

## CAUTION!
Some of these directories contain incomplete configurations, and must be integrated into your own existing configurations.

If you don't have a config, you can copy mine in the main daccfiles directory.
