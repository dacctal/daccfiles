# What is this?
This file is a colorscheme, specifically made for the LazyVim package manager. You'll have to copy it into your plugins folder if you've created one. If not, feel free to copy mine in the main daccfiles directory.

With some modification to its declaration, you might get this to work with packer and plug.
